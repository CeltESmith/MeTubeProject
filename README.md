# MeTubeProject

This project was to showcase some work within HTML
It is primarily just a snippit of a web page that is a youtube look alike.
This was maonly for laying out a web page so the buttons and links do not actually go any where due to me not having the sequential pages built myself.
one advanced feature that is emplamented in this is the use of floating tool tips that appear when you hover over their button.

To summarize it is just to show that I am able to layout a webpage.
